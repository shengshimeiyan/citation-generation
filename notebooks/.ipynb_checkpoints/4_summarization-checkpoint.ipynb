      "Non-standardized and TC-standardized hydrocarbon carotenoid concentrations, i.e., lycopene, α-carotene and β-carotene, were significantly (P < 0.0001) lowered after consumption of plant sterol-or plant stanol-enriched foods.\n",
      "β-Carotene For parallel studies, the weighted average baseline concentrations were calculated based on the baseline concentrations in the active and placebo groups and for crossover studies, the end-ofintervention concentrations of the placebo periods were used b For parallel studies, the weighted average concentrations after PS intervention were calculated based on the concentrations after PS intervention in the active groups and for crossover studies, the end-of-intervention concentrations of the active periods were used .\n",
      "Non-standardized tocopherol concentrations significantly (P < 0.0001) decreased after plant sterol or plant stanol consumption (α-tocopherol on average by 2.43 µmol/L (−7.1 %) and γ-tocopherol by 0.17 µmol/L (−6.9 %).\n",
      "However, when standardized for TC concentrations, α-and γ-tocopherol concentrations were no longer changed after plant sterol or plant stanol consumption (−0.3 and 0.2 %, respectively; P > 0.05).\n",
