      "Non-standardized and TC-standardized hydrocarbon carotenoid concentrations, i.e., lycopene, α-carotene and β-carotene, were significantly (P < 0.0001) lowered after consumption of plant sterol-or plant stanol-enriched foods.\n",

      "Non-standardized tocopherol concentrations significantly (P < 0.0001) decreased after plant sterol or plant stanol consumption (α-tocopherol on average by 2.43 µmol/L (−7.1 %) and γ-tocopherol by 0.17 µmol/L (−6.9 %).\n",
      "However, when standardized for TC concentrations, α-and γ-tocopherol concentrations were no longer changed after plant sterol or plant stanol consumption (−0.3 and 0.2 %, respectively; P > 0.05).\n",

      "cited: In the case of drugs that have a higher affinity for 5-HT 2C R than 5-HT 1B/1D R (as for MCPP; Barnes and Sharp 1999), the hyperactivity induced by the 5-HT 1B R can be counteracted by actions at the 5-HT 2C R. This explanation does not, however, resolve why indirect activation of 5-HT 1B/1D R following fenfluramine administration, even in the presence of SB 206553, did not result in hyperactivity.\n"
